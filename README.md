# PPL_242_MiniGo

My solution for the assignment of Principles of Programming Languages (CO3005) course at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT).

A simple programming language reminiscing Go (or Golang). I implemented the language following its specifications, using ANTLRv4 and Python.

Progress: Implementing Assignment 2 and fixing MiniGo.g4, due to the very low Parser score in Assignment 1.

Score distribution:
- Assignment 1: Lexer 97/100, Parser 12/100 (5.5).
- Assignment 2: TBD
